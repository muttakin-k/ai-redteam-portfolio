# ai-redteam-portfolio

In this repository, I will be doing the following:
1. Run one open-source/sandbox LLM and log 3 quick attack cases.
2. Draft a one-page taxonomy and a one-page playbook.
3. Write one polished red-team report (1 page + appendix).

I haven't decided the LLM just yet, I will be working on that as well.
Stay tuned!
