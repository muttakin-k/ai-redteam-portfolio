# ai-redteam-portfolio

In this repository, I will be doing the following:
1. Run one open-source/sandbox LLM and log 3 quick attack cases.
2. Draft a one-page taxonomy and a one-page playbook.
3. Write one polished red-team report (1 page + appendix).

I haven't decided the LLM just yet, I will be working on that as well.

# Plan for this repo going forward:
1. Make a portfolio: Prepare a GitHub (or private portfolio) with 4–6 artifacts:
2. Attack case repository: 8–12 reproducible cases grouped by category; each case has clear reproduction steps and suggested mitigations.
3. Annotated dataset: a labelled JSONL/CSV showing failures and taxonomy.
4. Playbook/taxonomy document — how you approach a new model, sample checklist.
5. Short red-team report — 1–2 polished reports (PDF/Markdown) showing communication skills.
6. Demo script or notebook — a runnable notebook that shows how you run a test and collect logs.
7. Readme & TL;DR — one-page summary of impact and what you contributed.

# 3-month practical roadmap (example)
1. Week 1–2: Foundations: Read high-level adversarial ML and prompt-injection concepts. Set up local sandbox model or API account. Start Git repo.
2. Week 3–6: Hands-on attacks + taxonomy: Create first 10 attack cases (jailbreaks, instruction override, hallucination). Design taxonomy and labels.
3. Week 7–10: Reporting & tooling: Build reproducible scripts/notebook. Produce 2 polished reports and the annotated dataset.
4. Week 11–12: Polish & interview prep: Finalize portfolio, craft 1-page playbook, rehearse demo and STAR interview answers.
**(Extend to 6 months as needed — add specialization like socio-technical probing, adversarial ML research, or cybersecurity tooling.)**
