# Setting up an LLM locally

I am currently trying to set up **LLAMA** locally on my machine. It will be an open-source LLM; among other ones, I have found this one to be appropriate for this project.
This isn't very easy. I am trying to follow the steps.
Once it is done, I will update the instructions on how to do this on Windows 11.
Stay tuned!
