**Safety & ethics (how to do this responsibly)**
1. Always use consent and legal/sandboxed environments.
2. Keep sensitive content out of public repos — anonymize or use synthetic examples.
3. Follow responsible disclosure for any real vulnerabilities.
4. Use wellness practices (breaks, rotate tasks) when reviewing sensitive material; the job posting said participation in high-sensitivity projects is optional — leverage that.
