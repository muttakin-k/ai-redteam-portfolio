When discussing these in interviews, emphasize methodology, reproducibility, and ethical safeguards.

5) Interview prep — sample questions & how to answer them

Practice concise answers + short demonstrations.

Examples:

“Walk me through a time you found a model vulnerability.” — Describe goal, setup, the exact input, model settings, reasoning why it’s a vulnerability, reproduction, and mitigation.

“How do you design a taxonomy for model failures?” — Show categories, labeling rules, inter-annotator agreement approach.

“How would you test a customer’s dialogue assistant for misinformation?” — Provide a checklist: seed prompts, adversarial prompts, persona manipulation, context injection, escalation paths, monitoring signals.

“How do you prioritize findings?” — Severity × exploitability × impact × reproducibility.

Live test task: they may give you a small model to probe. Be ready to run quick, structured tests and narrate findings.

Prepare 2-minute demos of:

One attack case reproduction.

How you classify and quantify severity for a set of failures.

6) Safety & ethics (how to do this responsibly)

Always use consent and legal/sandboxed environments.

Keep sensitive content out of public repos — anonymize or use synthetic examples.

Follow responsible disclosure for any real vulnerabilities.

Use wellness practices (breaks, rotate tasks) when reviewing sensitive material; the job posting said participation in high-sensitivity projects is optional — leverage that.
