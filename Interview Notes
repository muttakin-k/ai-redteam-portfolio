# When discussing these in interviews, emphasize methodology, reproducibility, and ethical safeguards.

**Interview prep — sample questions & how to answer them**
1. Practice concise answers + short demonstrations.
Examples:
“Walk me through a time you found a model vulnerability.” — Describe goal, setup, the exact input, model settings, reasoning why it’s a vulnerability, reproduction, and mitigation.
“How do you design a taxonomy for model failures?” — Show categories, labeling rules, inter-annotator agreement approach.
“How would you test a customer’s dialogue assistant for misinformation?” — Provide a checklist: seed prompts, adversarial prompts, persona manipulation, context injection, escalation paths, monitoring signals.
“How do you prioritize findings?” — Severity × exploitability × impact × reproducibility.

2. Live test task: they may give you a small model to probe. Be ready to run quick, structured tests and narrate findings.
3. Prepare 2-minute demos of:
a) One attack case reproduction.
b) How you classify and quantify severity for a set of failures.
